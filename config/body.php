    skills, my passion for flat illustration has grown. I am drawn toward modern art and a minimalist approach. There
     is a beauty that comes from simplicity and a welcome challenge in designing it. I have a background in branding
     and presentation design, and continue to be inspired by my community here in the San Francisco Bay Area. I am
     currently working as a designer for Duarte, Inc. where I tackle the demand for innovative design in a field that
      is constantly evolving. I dabble with calligraphy and enjoy putting together stellar dinner parties with
      friends. I have a passion for running, travel as much as I can, and obsess over French Bulldogs. I am a
      designer, an optimist, an explorer, and a modern woman looking to take on the world one challenge at a time.',
